# Venkata Krishna Sri Chandana Manuri

## Biography
Hello, wonderful people! I'm Chandana! ðŸŽ‰ While my name comes with many variations, Iâ€™m happiest just being called Chandana!

Currently, Iâ€™m immersing myself in a Master's in Business Analytics and Information Systems at USF. Before this adventure, I spent 2.5 years as a Custom Software Engineer (.NET) at Accenture. My tech journey began unexpectedly with a mechanical engineering degree, but building a website for my book club during the COVID lockdown ignited my passion for software development.

At Accenture, I realized how fast-paced the tech world isâ€”keeping up with the latest trends and tools is essential! That's why I chose to dive deeper into data, aiming to sharpen my skills and broaden my horizons.

When Iâ€™m not crunching numbers or coding, you can find me dancing my heart out or getting lost in fiction books. I love the escape they offerâ€”each page is a chance to live a different life!

Iâ€™d love to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts or book lovers, so feel free to reach out! Thanks for stopping by my markdown page! Toodles! ðŸŒŸ
