<h2>Poorna Chand Addala</h2>
<p>🎓 Greetings from the data realms! I go by the name Poorna Chand Addala, a seasoned Data Engineer navigating the vast seas of large-scale data management and processing systems for over 3 years. Beyond the digital frontiers, I'm on a quest to master the intricacies of Business Analytics & Information Systems from University of South Florida.

♟️ Beyond the tech horizon, I find joy in pushing my boundaries to acquire new skills. My leisure pursuits span from delving into books and engaging in strategic chess moves to the whimsical world of left-handed writing.
